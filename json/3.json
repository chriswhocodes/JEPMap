This repository is always open for new work. Every six months, in June and December, we initiate the release cycle for the next JDK feature release, hereinafter referred to as JDK $N. We fork the main-line repository into a stabilization repository, jdk/jdk$N, and use that repository for the remaining work needed to stabilize the release. That work proceeds over the next three months in three phases, described below: Rampdown Phase One (RDP 1) [\u200acandidate bugs\u200a] Rampdown Phase Two (RDP 2) [\u200acandidate bugs\u200a] Release-Candidate Phase (RC) [\u200acandidate bugs\u200a] The durations of the phases can vary from release to release, but as an example the phases for JDK 11 are four weeks for RDP 1, three weeks for RDP 2, and five weeks for RC. Each successive phase narrows the set of bugs that we examine, and subjects actions taken on those bugs to an increasingly-higher level of review. This ensures that, in each phase, we fix the bugs that need to be fixed at that time. It also ensures that we understand why we\u2019re not fixing some bugs that perhaps ought to be fixed but, for good reason, are better left to a future release. The phases thus make use of two approval processes, also described below: Bug-Deferral Process [\u200apending requests\u200a] Fix-Request Process [\u200apending requests\u200a] The overall feature set is frozen at RDP 1. No further JEPs will be targeted to the release after that point. Late, low-risk enhancements that add small bits of missing functionality or improve usability are permitted with approval in RDP 1 and RDP 2, especially when justified by developer feedback or JCP EG support, but the bar is very high in RDP 1 and extraordinarily high in RDP 2. You can request approval for a late enhancement via a third process: Late-Enhancement Request Process [\u200apending requests\u200a] Candidate bugs Each phase is driven by a list of candidate bugs. The candidate bugs in each phase are at or above that phase\u2019s priority threshold, which starts at P3 for RDP 1 and then increases to P2 for RDP 2 and P1 for RC. Each candidate bug is either A current bug, discovered in an early-access build of JDK $N and reported against that release via the Affects Version field, or A targeted bug, reported against some past release but targeted, via the Fix Version field, to JDK $N. A critical bug is a current bug whose priority is either P1 or P2 (in RDP 1 and RDP 2) or P1 (in RC). Queries for the candidate bugs for each phase are defined in JBS. To summarize: Priority Critical Query RDP 1 ≥ P3 ≥ P2 j.mp/jdk-rdp-1 RDP 2 ≥ P2 ≥ P2 j.mp/jdk-rdp-2 RC = P1 = P1 j.mp/jdk-rc Actions in a phase In each phase we aim to fix, drop, or defer each candidate bug. If you\u2019re responsible for a candidate bug then please take one of the following actions: Fix\u2001If the bug is current then develop a fix and either integrate it when ready (in RDP 1) or request approval to integrate it via the fix-request process (RDP 2 and RC). In RDP 1, if the bug is targeted and if time permits, develop and integrate a fix when ready. Drop\u2001If the bug is targeted, but not critical, then drop it from the release by either Clearing the Fix Version field, or Setting the Fix Version field to $N + 1 if you\u2019re reasonably confident that you\u2019ll fix the bug in the next release, or Setting the Fix Version field to tbd if you\u2019ve determined that the fix will not make the next release but might make some later release. Defer\u2001If the bug is critical but cannot be fixed in time, or is too risky to fix, then request approval to defer the bug from the release via the bug-deferral process. In any case, do not change the priority of a bug in order to remove it from the candidate list. The priority of a bug should reflect the importance of fixing it independent of any particular release, as has been standard practice for the JDK for many years. Non-candidate bugs If you\u2019re responsible for a non-candidate bug that\u2019s targeted to JDK $N via the Fix Version field then please drop it by either clearing that field, or setting it to $N + 1, or setting it to tbd, as above. There\u2019s no need to defer such bugs via the deferral process. Test and documentation bugs Bugs of any priority whose fixes only affect tests, or test-problem lists, or documentation may be fixed in RDP 1 and RDP 2. If you have a fix for such a bug then you don\u2019t need to request approval in order to integrate it, but please do make sure that the issue has a noreg-self or noreg-doc label, as appropriate. Bug-Deferral Process This process applies from RDP 1 until the end of the release. Requesting a deferral If you own a bug that will not be fixed in the current phase of development then you can request a deferral as follows: Update the JBS issue to add a comment whose first line is \u201cDeferral Request\u201d. In that comment briefly describe the reason for the deferral (e.g., insufficient time, complexity or risk of fix, etc.). Add the label jdk$N-defer-request to the issue, substituting the actual release version number for $N. Deferrals will not be granted for TCK issues identified by the label tck-red-$N, except possibly when new TCK tests are involved. Deferrals are unlikely for bugs that prevent release testing. Reviewing deferral requests The Area Leads, relevant Group Leads, and the JDK Project Lead will review the pending deferral requests on a regular basis, several times per week. One of them will take one of the following actions: Approve the request by adding the label jdk$N-defer-yes. Reject the request by adding the label jdk$N-defer-no, along with a comment describing the reason for this action. Request more information by adding the label jdk$N-defer-nmi (\u201cnmi\u201d = \u201cneeds more information\u201d), along with a comment describing what information is requested. In any case, do not remove the jdk$N-defer-request label. JBS query for pending requests: j.mp/jdk-defer-pending Responding to actions taken on your deferral request If you\u2019re asked to provide more information for a deferral request then please do so in a new comment in the issue, and then remove the jdk$N-defer-nmi label so that we see that it\u2019s ready for re-review. If your request is approved then no further action on your part is required. Fix-Request Process This process applies from RDP 2 until the end of the release. Requesting approval to integrate a fix Before you spend too much time on a fix for a P1 or P2 bug, seek advice from a Group or Area Lead, on an appropriate mailing list, to make sure that fixing the bug in this release is actually a reasonable idea. When you are nearly ready with a fix then update the JBS issue to add a comment whose first line is \u201cFix Request\u201d. In that comment briefly describe why it\u2019s important to fix this bug, explain the nature of the fix, estimate its risk, describe its test coverage, and indicate who has reviewed it. If you have a webrev for the fix then include a link to that in the comment; otherwise, attach the patch for the fix to the JBS issue. Add the label jdk$N-fix-request to the issue, substituting the actual release version number for $N. Reviewing fix requests The Area Leads, relevant Group Leads, and the JDK Project Lead will review the pending fix requests on a regular basis, at least weekly to start and more frequently as we approach the GA date. In case of an urgent situation you are welcome to contact an appropriate reviewer directly in order to solicit a prompt review. A reviewer will take one of the following actions: Approve the request by adding the label jdk$N-fix-yes, along with a comment recording their approval whose first line is \u201cFix request approved\u201d. Reject the request by adding the label jdk$N-fix-no, along with a comment describing the reason for this action whose first line is \u201cFix request rejected\u201d. Request more information by adding the label jdk$N-fix-nmi (\u201cnmi\u201d = \u201cneeds more information\u201d), along with a comment describing what information is requested whose first line is \u201cFix request NMI\u201d. In any case, do not remove the original jdk$N-fix-request label. JBS query for pending fix requests: j.mp/jdk-fix-pending Responding to actions taken on your fix request If you\u2019re asked to provide more information for a fix request then please do so in a new comment in the issue, and then remove the jdk$N-fix-nmi label so that we see that it\u2019s ready for re-review. If your request is approved then proceed to complete the fix and integrate it. If your request is rejected then you may appeal that decision to the Project Lead. In any case, do not remove the original jdk$N-fix-request label. Late-Enhancement Request Process This process applies from RDP 1 until the end of the RDP 2. Requesting approval for a late enhancement If you wish to integrate an enhancement in RDP 1 or RDP 2 then you can request approval as follows: Update the JBS issue to add a comment whose first line is \u201cLate Enhancement Request\u201d. In that comment describe the risk level, a brief justification that quotes actual developer feedback if possible, and your best estimate of the date by which you\u2019ll integrate it. Add the label jdk$N-enhancement-request to the issue, substituting the actual release version number for $N. Enhancements to tests and documentation during RDP 1 and RDP 2 do not require approval, as long as the relevant issues are identified with a noreg-self or noreg-doc label, as appropriate. Reviewing enhancement requests The JDK Project Lead or a delegate, in case of absence, will review the pending enhancement requests on a regular basis, several times per week. They will take one of the following actions: Approve the request by adding the label jdk$N-enhancement-yes. Reject the request by adding the label jdk$N-enhancement-no, along with a comment describing the reason for this action. Request more information by adding the label jdk$N-enhancement-nmi (\u201cnmi\u201d = \u201cneeds more information\u201d), along with a comment describing what information is requested. In any case, do not remove the jdk$N-enhancement-request label. JBS query for pending requests: j.mp/jdk-enhancement-pending Responding to actions taken on your enhancement request If you\u2019re asked to provide more information for an enhancement request then please do so in a new comment in the issue, and then remove the jdk$N-enhancement-nmi label so that we see that it\u2019s ready for re-review. If your request is approved then update the issue\u2019s due date to the expected completion date.","updated":"2018/08/09 18:12","status":"Active"}
